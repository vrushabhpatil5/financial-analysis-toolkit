# Financial Analysis Toolkit

A practical toolkit applying core financial analysis concepts such as NPV,
IRR, payback period, and ratio analysis.

This project focuses on bridging financial theory with real-world
decision-making using clear and transparent models.

## Modules
- NPV & IRR Calculator (Python + CSV)
- Ratio Analysis (profitability, liquidity, leverage)
- DCF Sensitivity (WACC × Terminal Growth) with CSV output for Excel

## How to Run
